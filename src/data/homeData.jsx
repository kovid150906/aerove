      "Team AeRoVe of UMIC is on a never-ending pursuit of developing an ultimate system of autonomous fixed-wing as well as multirotor aircraft. Incorporating different subsystems namely 'Mechatronics', 'Controls', 'Machine Learning', 'Perception', 'Path Planning', and 'Localisation', the team emphatically covers every aspect to forge a de rigueur system of autonomous aerial vehicles.",
      "At Team AeRoVe, we always look for problems that challenge, excite, and motivate us to grow intellectually. Our purpose is to further the boundaries of autonomous aerial technology and realize the true potential of this field. We aim to contribute and start the culture of creating cutting edge technology through indigenous innovation.",
      "The International Aerial Robotics Competition, the longest-running aerial robotics competition in the world, is the kind of problem that has pushed us to the best of our capabilities and made us think in ways like never before, providing us with an international platform to display our aptitudes."
